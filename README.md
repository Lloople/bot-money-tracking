## About Me (Mr Debts)

Add me to your group of friends in Telegram to track your debts! üí∞

## How To Use

First of all you need to register your group with me, you can do it in 3 different ways:
- Add me to your friends group
- Create a group with me on the same process
- Say `/register` to me in an existing group

Then I'll ask you about the language you want to use. I can work with **English (en)**, **Catalan (ca)** and **Spanish (es)** for now.

Next step is to know the currency you want to work on the group. Currently supported are **Dollar ($)**, **Euro (‚Ç¨)** and **GBP (¬£)**

After this process is completed, you can start to debt money to your friends and I'll remember
all for you. You can tell me like:

- `@marcel owes me 200` 
- `@christoph paid me 25`
- `I paid 300 to @marcel` (same as `@marcel owes me 300`)
- `I owe 10 to @christoph` (same as `@christoph paid me 10`)

You can do it by commands if you feel comfortable:

- `/debt 10 @christoph` (same as `I owe 10 to @christoph`)
- `/paid 200 @marcel` (same as `@marcel owes me 200`)

You can see your current balance at every moment using `/balance` or sending the money emoji üí∞ or üíµ

- Help command is still Work In Progress üôè
