## About Mr Debts

Add me to your group of friends in Telegram to track your debts! üí∞

## How To Use

First of all you need to register your group with this bot, you can do it in 3 different ways:
- Add this bot to a group
- Create a group with this bot on the same process
- Say `/register` to the bot

Then I'll ask you about the language you want to use. Currently supported:
- English (en)
- Catalan (ca)
- Spanish (es)

Then I'll need to know the currency you want to work on the group. Currently supported:
- Dollar ($)
- Euro (‚Ç¨)
- GBP (¬£)

After this process is completed, you can start to debt money to your friends and I'll remember
all for you. You can tell me like: (currency is optional)

- `@marcel owes me 200‚Ç¨` 
- `@christoph paid me 25‚Ç¨`
- `I paid 300‚Ç¨ to @marcel` (same as `@marcel owes me 300‚Ç¨`)
- `I owe 10‚Ç¨ to @christoph` (same as `@christoph paid me 10‚Ç¨`)

You can do it by commands if you feel comfortable:

- `/debt 10 @christoph` (same as `I owe 10‚Ç¨ to @christoph`)
- `/paid 200 @marcel` (same as `@marcel owes me 200‚Ç¨`)

You can see your current balance at every moment using `/balance` or sending the money emoji üí∞ or üíµ

- Help command is still Work In Progress üôè
